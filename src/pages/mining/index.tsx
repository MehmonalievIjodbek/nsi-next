        Iron, ferroalloys and non-ferrous metals are needed in most industrial
        and consumer products today. Whether it be for iron, nickel, copper,
        lithium or other elements, NSI provides a number of tailor-made
        solutions for extraction which are both socially and environmentally
        acceptable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whilst planning these solutions, NSI focuses especially on optimized
        operation and maintenance, and making efficient use of energy and water.
        Good water management, one of NSIâ€™s key competencies, is of utmost
        importance in mining. Together with partners, NSI is also able to
        deliver all the engineering services required for the mining industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        NSI provides integrated, interdisciplinary services for LNG projects
        from the initial study, through the design and tender phase to
        commissioning and start-up. Emphasis is always placed on developing
        individual solutions that take complex framework conditions into
        account.
