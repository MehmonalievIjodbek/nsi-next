When modernizing industrial production  facilities, the most important goals are to improve energy and material efficiency, optimize processes and make warehousing and logistics cost-efficient. The main challenge whilst pursuing these goals is the optimization of the human-machine interface using secure  IoT solutions.",
  "chemicals-dec2": "Modernization of industrial facilities is today often to be embedded into a circular economy approach. NSI combines the knowledge of industrial processes with sustainable solutions and over decades developed project management know-how.",
  "chemicals-dec3": "Project implementation at NSI is often carried out in existing plants that are in operation. During this process, the minimization of shutdown times is the decisive criterion.",
